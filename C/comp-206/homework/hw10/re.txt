1. The read_stdin_line function is unsafe. It takes in a buffer of specific size, but converts it into a char* and reads undefinitely from stdin. This can cause a buffer overflow if stdin has more characters that the size of the buffer.

2. 
0x0000000000001215 <+12>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp
-0x4],0x0 (Set admin = 0)
0x000000000000121c <+19>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp
-0x8],0x0 (Set login_successful = 0)

3. Buf is not initializes since it has no initializing code associated to it. Plus, it is directly set by the read_stdin_line function so the compiler deemed it unecessary.

4. It is passed [rbp-0x30], from 0x0000000000001223 <+26>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x30]

5. From higher address to lower address:
- [rbp]  <- old rbp
- [rbp-0x4] : admin (4 bytes)
- [rbp-0x8] : login_succesful (4 bytes)
- [rbp-0x9] .. [rbp-0x30] : buf (40 bytes)
- (unused)

6. I inputed "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" to reach the FLAG: REDACTED since according to the diagram, we see that buf is of 40 bytes and admin is set 4 bytes before buf. Therefore, I simply overflowed the buffer by inputting over 44 characters, and overriding 'admin' with my character. 

7. Flag: YOUARE_A_TETRISCHAMPION

8. A small change would be to check whether login_successful is equal to 1 instead of doing !login_successful
