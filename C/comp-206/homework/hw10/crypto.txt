1. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability

Confidentiality: Ensure information is only given to authorized people while blocking the information from those who are not given authorized access.

Integrity: Makes sure that the data is accurate and complete, and can't be modified by without authorization.

Availability: Ensure the information is accessible and usable by those with authorization whenever it is needed.

a) This attacks availability since the attacks blocks access to patients' information for the duration of the attack.

b) This attacks confidentiality, as the attacker is selling the information to unauthorized users.

3. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is usually used to share a secret key between two endpoints over a insecure channel without presharing it. It is useful when wanting to encrypt messages using a private key but without having yet shared a secret key between both parties.

4. RSA can prove omnership of a private key through digital signitures. Since only they have the private key, they can encrypt a message with that private key, and have anyone decrypt it with the public key, proving authentication and integrity of the message.

5. Assuming a preshared key, we can attach a Message Authentication Code (MAC) using HMAC, where:
- First, compute HMAC using a hash function like SHA-256 that utilizes the key
- Second, append this MAC to the text file
- Third, recompute the HMAC using the preshared key K and the received message
- Lastly, if the computed MAC matches the other MAC, the author is verified and the message was not altered.
